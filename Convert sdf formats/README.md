# Description

This script removes tags from sdf 1.6, which are not compatible with sdf 1.4
The script is useful if you, e.g., have created a Gazebo world in Kinetic or Melodic, which you want to run in Indigo.

I add new tags whenever I encounter problems, but feel free to send a pull-request, if some tags are missing
